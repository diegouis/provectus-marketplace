## Proposal Drafting

### Proposal Structure

Every proposal should follow this ordered progression:

1. **Executive Summary** - The client's problem restated in their language, your approach in one paragraph, and the expected business outcome
2. **Understanding of Requirements** - Demonstrate that you have listened; restate scope, constraints, and success criteria
3. **Proposed Solution** - Technical approach, methodology, architecture, and tooling with clear rationale
4. **Team and Qualifications** - Key personnel, relevant experience, and case studies that mirror the client's situation
5. **Timeline and Milestones** - Phased delivery plan with checkpoints and deliverables per phase
6. **Pricing** - Transparent cost breakdown with options (fixed-price, T&M, hybrid) and payment schedule
7. **Terms and Assumptions** - Dependencies, exclusions, change request process, and risk mitigations
8. **Appendices** - Resumes, certifications, architecture diagrams, references

### Proposal Writing Principles

- Lead with value, not features; every section should answer "so what?" for the client
- Personalize using research on the client's industry, recent news, and stated pain points
- Keep executive summaries under 300 words; decision-makers scan, they do not read
- Include one clear call-to-action on the final page
- Reference specific outcomes from similar engagements with quantified results
- Address objections preemptively in the Terms section

### Ad and Messaging Analysis

When analyzing competitor marketing:

- Extract and categorize messaging themes (problems highlighted, use cases targeted, value propositions)
- Identify successful ad patterns (visual formats, copy length, CTA styles)
- Map audience targeting by ad variation (enterprise vs. SMB vs. startup messaging)
- Track messaging evolution over time to detect strategic shifts
- Identify gaps in competitor messaging that represent positioning opportunities

## Pricing and Quote Generation

### Pricing Strategy Framework

Build pricing models around these components:

1. **Cost-Plus Baseline** - Calculate fully loaded cost (labor, tools, overhead) and target margin
2. **Value-Based Adjustment** - Adjust pricing based on the measurable business value delivered to the client
3. **Competitive Positioning** - Position relative to market alternatives (premium, parity, or value)
4. **Risk Allocation** - Adjust for fixed-price risk premiums, scope uncertainty buffers, and technology risk

### Pricing Models

| Model | When to Use | Risk Profile |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Fixed Price | Clear scope, well-understood requirements, short duration | Higher risk to seller |
| Time and Materials | Evolving scope, R&D projects, ongoing engagements | Higher risk to buyer |
| Hybrid (T&M with cap) | Moderate uncertainty, client needs budget predictability | Balanced risk |
| Retainer | Ongoing advisory, support, or fractional team | Predictable for both |
| Outcome-Based | High-confidence ROI, measurable KPIs, strong track record | Highest risk to seller |

| Average deal cycle | 4-8 weeks | Investigate stalled deals if above |
| Pipeline coverage | 3-4x quota | Increase prospecting if below |
| Stage conversion rates | Steady or improving | Analyze drop-off points |
| Average deal size | Trending up or stable | Review pricing strategy if declining |
| Forecast accuracy | Within 10% of actual | Improve stage criteria definitions |

## Outreach and Follow-Up

### Cold Email Sequence Pattern

**Email 1: Value-First Introduction**
- Subject line: Specific to their pain point, under 50 characters
- Open with research insight about their company
- One sentence on how you solve that specific problem
- Social proof: one similar client result with a number
- CTA: Ask for 15 minutes, not a demo

**Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 3)**
- Reference Email 1 briefly
- Share a relevant case study or insight
- Different angle on the same pain point
- Same CTA, rephrased

**Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)**
- Acknowledge they are busy
- Provide one more piece of value (article, benchmark, insight)
- Offer to reconnect when timing is better
- No pressure CTA

### Outreach Personalization Variables

For each prospect, research and incorporate:
- Recent company news or announcements
- Specific job postings that signal relevant needs
- Mutual connections or shared experiences
- Industry-specific challenges affecting their vertical
- Technology decisions visible in their stack

## Stakeholder Engagement for Enterprise Deals

### Stakeholder Mapping

For enterprise deals, map the buying committee using a Power/Interest grid:

- **Champion** (High Power, High Interest) - Your internal advocate; nurture this relationship
- **Economic Buyer** (High Power, Variable Interest) - Controls budget; communicate ROI and risk mitigation
- **Technical Evaluator** (Variable Power, High Interest) - Validates technical fit; provide depth and proof
- **End Users** (Low Power, High Interest) - Will use the solution; demonstrate ease of use and value
- **Blocker** (Variable Power, Variable Interest) - May resist; understand their concerns and address directly

### Engagement Cadence by Stakeholder Type

| Stakeholder | Frequency | Format | Content Focus |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Champion | Weekly | 1:1 call or Slack | Deal progress, obstacles, coaching |
| Economic Buyer | Bi-weekly | Email summary | ROI, risk, timeline, investment |
| Technical Evaluator | As needed | Deep-dive sessions | Architecture, security, integration |
| End Users | During demos | Interactive demos | Workflow improvements, ease of use |

## Visual Diagramming with Excalidraw

Use the Excalidraw MCP server to generate interactive diagrams directly in the conversation. Describe what you need in natural language and Excalidraw renders it as an interactive canvas with hand-drawn style.

### When to Use

- Sales funnel and deal flow stage diagrams
- Competitive landscape and market positioning maps
- Proposal architecture and pricing flow visualizations
- Pipeline management and forecast diagrams

### Workflow

1. Describe the diagram you need — be specific about components, relationships, and layout
2. Review the rendered interactive diagram in the chat
3. Request refinements by describing what to change (add/remove/rearrange elements)
4. Use fullscreen mode for detailed editing when needed

### Tips for Effective Diagrams

- Name specific components and their connections (e.g., "API Gateway connects to Auth Service and User Service")
- Specify layout direction when it matters (e.g., "left-to-right flow" or "top-down hierarchy")
- Request specific diagram types (architecture diagram, flowchart, sequence diagram, ER diagram)
- Iterate — start with the overall structure, then refine details
