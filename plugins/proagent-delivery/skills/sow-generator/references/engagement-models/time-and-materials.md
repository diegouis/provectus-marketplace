# Time & Materials (T&M)

**Best for:** Evolving requirements, R&D projects, ongoing support, engagements where scope changes frequently.

## Characteristics

- Client pays for hours/days worked at agreed rates per sprint or per pod
- Scope is directional — priorities can shift sprint-to-sprint
- Client controls what gets built and in what order
- Lower risk for Provectus, higher flexibility for the client

## SOW Structure Specifics

**Section 4 (Project Scope):**
- Scope describes workstreams and "areas of focus" rather than fixed deliverables
- Use "Potential Areas of Focus" or "Prioritized Initiatives" framing
- Include methodology statement: "Provectus will collaborate closely with [Client] and follow the methodology and/or practices of the existing team"

**Section 5 (Estimated Durations & Team):**
- Timeboxed engagement (e.g., "3 months, 6 two-week sprints")
- Team described as a pod with fixed capacity
- Allocation in percentages (100%, 50%, 10%)

**Section 6 (Payment & Fee Schedule):**
- Open with: "Time & Materials. Provectus estimates that [Client]'s total payment under this Statement of Work will be $[X] unless specified through a change order"
- Cost table: `Description | Duration (Sprints) | Cost per Sprint | Estimated Total`
- Invoice schedule aligned to sprints (monthly)
- Include termination clause with 30-day notice

**Real example (Natera SOW #28):**
```
| Description | Duration (Sprints) | Cost per Sprint | Estimated Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Pod | 6 | $16,560 | $99,360 |
| | | Total Cost | $99,360 |
```
