# Milestone-Based

**Best for:** Medium-complexity projects where the client wants accountability tied to results but also some flexibility.

## Characteristics

- Hybrid between T&M and Fixed-Price
- Project divided into milestones, each with defined deliverables and a price
- Payment triggered by milestone acceptance
- Balanced risk: Provectus commits to deliverables, client pays on acceptance

## SOW Structure Specifics

**Section 4 (Project Scope):**
- Scope organized into 3-6 milestones
- Each milestone has its own scope, deliverables, and acceptance criteria
- Milestones can have dependencies or be parallel

**Section 5 (Estimated Durations & Team):**
- Timeline broken into milestone phases
- Team may vary between phases

**Section 6 (Payment & Fee Schedule):**
- Payment per milestone upon acceptance
- Total is sum of all milestone prices
- Include milestone acceptance process and timeline

**Payment table pattern** (synthetic — none of the 5 sample Provectus SOWs used milestone-based billing; this pattern is based on industry standards):
```
| Milestone | Deliverables | Price | Payment Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1: Architecture Approved | Architecture doc, tech specs | $XX,XXX | Sign-off by CTO |
| M2: MVP Deployed | API, Frontend, staging deploy | $XX,XXX | QA test suite passing |
| M3: Production Release | Production deploy, runbook | $XX,XXX | Load test passed |
| **Total** | | **$XXX,XXX** | |
```

## When to Recommend

- Client wants more accountability than T&M but more flexibility than fixed-price
- Project has natural phase boundaries (discovery, build, deploy)
- Multiple stakeholders need visibility into progress and spend

## Key Clauses

- Milestone acceptance process and timeline
- Deemed acceptance after review period (5-10 business days)
- Milestone re-sequencing process (if priorities shift)
- Change orders apply per-milestone for scope additions
