# Fixed-Price

**Best for:** Well-defined scope, budget-constrained clients, compliance-driven projects, one-time builds.

## Characteristics

- Client pays a fixed total for defined scope and deliverables
- Scope is locked — changes require formal Change Orders
- Higher risk for Provectus (must estimate accurately), lower risk for the client
- Requires thorough Discovery phase or clear scope definition upfront

## SOW Structure Specifics

**Section 4 (Project Scope):**
- Scope is exhaustive with specific deliverables, quantities, and acceptance criteria
- Use "In-Scope Activities" and "Out of Scope" sub-sections explicitly
- Every scope item must be independently verifiable

**Section 5 (Estimated Durations & Team):**
- Fixed timeline with defined phases
- Team described with specific roles and allocations
- May include phase-by-phase breakdown

**Section 6 (Payment & Fee Schedule):**
- Open with: "Fixed Fee. [Client] total payment under this Statement of Work will be $[X]"
- May include milestone-based payment schedule
- Include invoicing cadence (monthly)

**Real example (GANT SOW #3):**
```
Fixed Fee. GANT Travel total payment under this Statement of Work will be $250,000
unless specified through a change order and following the prescribed change order process.
```

**Optional: Completion/Success Criteria (recommended for fixed-price, insert before Signatures or as a sub-section of Section 4):**
- Define measurable success criteria
- "The MVP will be deemed successful if..." pattern
- Each criterion should be independently verifiable

## When to Recommend

- Client needs budget certainty
- Scope is well-understood (ideally post-Discovery)
- Compliance or procurement requires fixed pricing
- Project has a clear start and end with defined outcomes

## Pricing Guidance

- Add 15-25% buffer to ROM estimates when setting fixed price
- Include assumptions that, if violated, may adjust the price
- Define "defect" (warranty) vs. "enhancement" (change order)

## Key Clauses

- Detailed scope with explicit inclusions and exclusions
- Change Order process with cost and timeline impact
- Completion/success criteria section
- 30-day termination notice with liability for remaining fees
